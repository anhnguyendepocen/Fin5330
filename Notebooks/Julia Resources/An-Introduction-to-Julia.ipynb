    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "* Julia is a new general purpose programming language that is focused on numerical and statistical computing. Its development began at MIT in 2009. In 2018 it reached a stable 1.0 release. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* From Caraiani: _\"The main attractiveness of the [sic] Julia comes from combining the high level syntax of languages like Python and Matlab with the speed of low level languages like Fortran and C/C++.\"_ It is said that Julia solves the two language problem. See [this article (https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-02310-3) at Nature for more details. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is how the Julia design team position their language. See the language website: https://julialang.org/\n",
    "\n",
    "### Julia is fast!\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia was designed from the beginning for high performance. Julia programs compile to efficient native code for multiple platforms via LLVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Dynamic\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is dynamically-typed, feels like a scripting language, and has good support for interactive use.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Optionally typed\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia has a rich language of descriptive datatypes, and type declarations can be used to clarify and solidify programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### General\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia uses multiple dispatch as a paradigm, making it easy to express many object-oriented and functional programming patterns. It provides asynchronous I/O, debugging, logging, profiling, a package manager, and more.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Easy to use\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia has high level syntax, making it an accessible language for programmers from any background or experience level. Browse the Julia microbenchmarks to get a feel for the language.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Open source\n",
    "\n",
    "Julia is provided under the MIT license, free for everyone to use. All source code is publicly viewable on GitHub.\n",

    "### Installing Julia\n",
    "\n",
    "* To install Julia go to the [Julia downloads page](https://julialang.org/downloads/) and make the proper selection for your operating system (Windows or Mac OS - if you're on Linux I'm just going to assume you're okay on your own).\n",
    "\n",
    "* As of the time of writing this most current version of Julia is v1.3.1. Make sure that you get at least this version. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Installing Anaconda\n",
    "\n",
    "I also strongly suggest that you install the Anaconda system. \n",
    "\n",
    "* Go to the [Anaconda downloads page](https://www.anaconda.com/distribution/) and make the proper selection for your operating system (again either Windows or Mac OS). \n",
    "\n",
    "* Make sure to get at least v3.7 of Python. \n",
    "\n",
    "* This will give us Jupyter Lab and an installation of Python to work with from Julia. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Text Editors\n",
    "\n",
    "You will want to choose a good text editor. \n",
    "\n",
    "* If you don't have a strong preference then use Jupyter Lab. I'll be demonstrating this in class.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* Julia comes bundled with a text editor called Juno, which is based off of Atom. It's pretty good. It's the straight forward editor to use if you don't know how to choose. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) offers a good combination of simplicity and power.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* I really like [Neovim](https://neovim.io/). Vim gives you super powers but has a steep learning curve. \n",
    "    - Learning Vim was an intellectual lightning strike for me!\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "* [Emacs](https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/) is nutso powerful and has a nearly infinite learning curve. Extra credit for the Brave and True!\n",
    "    - See what writer Neal Stephenson has to say about Emacs: https://www.emacswiki.org/emacs/NealStephenson\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "* Of course, Buddha who always advocated the [Middle Way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Way) would use [Doom](https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs) if he were alive today!\n",
    "    - Doom is Emacs with a builtin Vim emulator. It's the *Shiz* - is what I think the kids say these days!\n",
    "    - See these YouTube videos if you decide to follow this path: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rCMh7srOqvw\n",

    "\n",

Similar to other programming languages such as Python and R, Julia is an extensible language. This means that we can write code to extend Julia's base capabilities. \n",
    "\n",
